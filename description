StartupIntel is an automated startup intelligence pipeline that discovers recently funded startups by scanning global funding news and extracting structured company-level signals. 
The pipeline ingests recent articles from the GDELT news index, extracts clean article text, and uses a large language model to identify startups, funding amounts, funding rounds, investors, and funding dates. 
It is designed to correctly handle both single-company funding articles and multi-startup funding roundups, producing a startup-level dataset rather than an article-level one.
The system deduplicates startups across all articles, enriches each unique company with its official website, career page, and a technical hiring signal, and outputs the final dataset to both a Google Sheet and a local CSV file. 
StartupIntel is built using Python, OpenAI’s API for information extraction, LangGraph for pipeline orchestration, DuckDuckGo search for domain discovery, and the Google Sheets API for data delivery, mirroring how real-world venture sourcing and market intelligence pipelines are structured.
